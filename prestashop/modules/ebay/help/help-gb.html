		<h2 id="EbayHelpPart1">How to get started on eBay ?</h2>
		<p>More information is available from the Business Centre on <a href="http://pages.ebay.co.uk/businesscentre/index.html" target="_blank"><u>http://pages.ebay.co.uk/businesscentre/index.html</u></a></p><br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart1-1"><u>1) 1) Register as a business seller</u></h3>
		<p>First you need to register as an eBay business seller using a <a href="https://scgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?RegisterEnterInfo&bizflow=2">registration form</a>. Choose a username and a password, enter your personal and company details (address, telephone number etc.) and you are ready to go! If you already have a private eBay account, <a href="https://scgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ChangeRegistrationAccountType">simply upgrade it to a business account.</a></p>
		<br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart1-3"><u>2) Link your PayPal account to your eBay account</u></h3>
		<p>If you do not already have a PayPal Business account, you should first create one on the PayPal website: <a href="https://www.paypal.com/uk/webapps/mpp/home-merchant">create your PayPal Business account</a><br />
		If you already have a PayPal account, link it to your eBay account on the <a href="http://my.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?MyeBay&CurrentPage=MyeBayMyAccounts">My Account page</a>.</p>
		<br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart1-4"><u>3) Open an eBay shop</u></h3>
		<p>An eBay shop subscription reduces the listing fees that you pay per listed item on eBay. <a href="http://pages.ebay.co.uk/help/sell/storefees.html">Details on eBay listing fees with shop subscription  </a></p>
		<br />

		<h3 align="center">Now you can list your products using the Prestashop eBay module!</h3>


		<br />
		<hr />
		<br />


		<h2 id="EbayHelpPart2">How does the Prestashop eBay module work?</h2>

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart2-1">1) "Parameters" tab</h3>
		<p>
		This section should be configured when using the module for the first time. You should set your PayPal account as a payment method for products on eBay by providing the email address that you use for your PayPal account.  <br/>
		You should set the delivery method and charges which will be applied to your products on eBay.
		</p>


		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart2-2">2) "Category settings" tab</h3>
		<p>
			Before listing your products on eBay, you should link the product categories from your Prestashop shop with those from eBay. You can also choose to sell the products from your Prestashop shop at a different price on eBay. This effect on the price is set as a percentage or an absolute value.<br/><br/>
Please note that it is not yet possible to list in categories in which eBay requires item specifics. This applies particularly to all Fashion-categories on ebay.co.uk.


		</p>
		<br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart2-3">3) "Template manager" tab</h3>
		<p>To optimise the design of your product information on eBay, you can personalise the header and the footer of your listings by creating a template which is applied to all of your products on eBay. By giving your listings your own style (logo, colours, etc.), you will become more well-known and more attractive as a seller on eBay. A template which is well-thought out and presented in a professional and attractive manner will often make a big difference to buyers. </p>
		<br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart2-4">4) "eBay Sync" tab</h3>
		<p>This section allows you to list your products on eBay. You can list all products from your Prestashop shop on eBay (recommended) or only products from certain categories.</p>
		<br />

		<h2 id="EbayHelpPart3">Tips for successful selling on eBay </h2>

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart3-1">Tip No. 1: Provide good product details</h3>
		<p>
		On eBay, as elsewhere, products must be well-presented in order to sell well. A product that is poorly photographed or poorly described will not sell. There are therefore certain standards to be met before listing your products on eBay. This allows you to have a good product listing on eBay, increase your sales and become more visible.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Title</strong> (field limited to 80 characters)<br/>
				A good title should include the following information: Type of product > Model > Main features > Brand<br/>
				It should also use relevant key words: determine in advance the key words which are most searched for by eBay users.<br/>
				AVOID: abbreviations, titles shortened to fit 80 characters, details which are too technical, punctuation etc.<br/>
			</li>
			<li><strong>Price and postage costs</strong><br />To avoid being penalised by the search algorithm, the price and postage costs of your item should be in line with the general offering available on eBay.<br/>
Free delivery (postage costs included) gives you extra visibility on the results pages.
</li>
			<li><strong>Product description/details </strong><br />The product description should be clear and precise, it should mention the key features of your products and any guarantees, and clearly indicate the conditions and procedures for delivery and returns. Finally, a listing should be formatted in an attractive way (pictures, logos etc.) and should be suited to your profile as a seller.</li>
			<li><strong>Photo quality</strong><br />Minimum of 3 photos (1 main + 2 in the description), which should be of high quality and on a white background. Photos of details if necessary. Photos are as informative as a well-written description and are often a determining factor for potential buyers.</li>
		</ul>
		<br />

		<h3 id="EbayHelpPart3-2">Tip No. 2: Maintain a good seller profile</h3>
		<p>You are responsible for maintaining a good relationship with your buyers who will give feedback on your seller performance. To have a successful seller profile, get positive feedback and increase buyers' confidence in you, you should fulfil your obligations as a seller and provide good customer service.</p>
		<p>You should meet seller performance standards required by eBay: maintaining an average of at least 4.40 on each of the detailed seller ratings awarded by buyers after a transaction. <br/>
To achieve a customer satisfaction rating of 4.8 on your seller profile, you need to focus your customer service on the following 4 criteria:
</p>
		<ul>
			<li><u>Item as described :</u> see Tip No. 1 Product description</li>
			<li><u>Communication :</u> promptly answering questions before and after sale (Messages in "My eBay")</li>
			<li><u>Dispatch time :</u> ensure quick delivery. Keep an eye on stock levels (dispatch time extended when a product is unavailable)</li>
			<li><u>Postage and packaging charges :</u> free delivery helps you to get 5/5 rating for this criteria</li>
		</ul>

		<p><u>NB :</u> The "Selling Manager Pro" tool allows you to automate some of these customer relations tasks and will save you time.<br /><a href="http://pages.ebay.co.uk/selling_manager_pro/" target="_blank"><u>Souscrire au Gestionnaire de ventes Pro</u></a></p>
